=================================================================================
This directory contains some demonstrations for cxxtools.

The examples are as minimal as possible to demonstrate simple usage-patterns.

arg
===
Demonstration of template `cxxtools::Arg`.

dir
===
Print contents of a directory. Try `./dir .`.

dlloader
========
Load shared library and call a function. Useful to create plugins in your
applications.

getini
======
Read value from ini-file.

Try `./getini test.ini sec1 value`

hdstream
========
Just a little hexdumper. To print a hexdump of a file use `./hexdump filename`

log
===
Demonstration of cxxtools-logging-library.

It uses a configurationfile log.xml or log.properties to determine the amount of
logging.

A sample configuration file log.xml can be created with the command
`cxxtools-config --logxml cxxtools >log.xml`.

md5sum
======
Calculate md5sum of files. Try `./md5sum file1 file2`

multifstream
============
Concatenate multipe files to stdout. Try `./multiifstream file1 file2`.

netcat/netecho
==============
Demonstration of a simple network-server and -client.

Netcat listens to a port (default 1234) and prints all input to stdout.

Netecho connects to netcat and copies stdin to netcat.

To try out enter `./netcat` in one terminal and then `./netcat <netcat.cpp`
in another. Netcat prints the sourcecode of netcat.cpp. If netcat runs
on another machine, you need to tell netcat the ip-address of the netcat-server
with `./netcat -i host`.

netio
=====
Network-performance tool.

Netio has 2 modes: server and client. To enable server-mode start with option
-s. It waits for a incoming connection on port 1234 (adjustable with -p).

In client-mode you need to give netio the ip-address (or hostname) of the
server with -i. The clients sends random data with different package-sizes to
the server and computes the network-througput. It starts with 256 bytes and
doubles until 64k. Each package-size is sent for 1 second (adjustable with -t).
With -B you can specify a single fixed block-size.

pipestream
==========
This demo shows, how to create a child-process, use a pipe to signal
from child to parent and another pipe to send a datastream.

pool
====
Demonstration of template pool. Example connectionpool. Useful for
multithreaded applications.

serialization/deseriaization
============================
Show how to convert C++ objects to json, xml or csv and back.

`serialization` creates a vector of 2 C++ objects and depending on the command
line option prints them as json, xml or csv.

If called with option -x, the output is xml. Giving option -c prints csv.
Without those, json is printed.

The option -b formats the output nicely. It has no effect on csv.

`deserialization` reads formatted input from stdin and converts them to C++. It
expects the same list of objects as the `serialization` demo program prints. The
formatting options `-x` and `-c` are also valid for `deserialization` to tell
the process, what format it should read.

To try the programs out, you can call:

    ./serialization|./deserialization

    ./serialization -x|./deserialization -x

    ./serialization -c|./deserialization -c

msgclient/msgserver
===================
This shows a little messaging client and server.

The server starts and waits for a incoming connection. When a connection
arrives it sends 2 messages to the client.

The client connects on startup to the server and reads messages until the
socket is closed.

The messages are serialized using binary serialization. It is easy to send and
receive more complex messages over a socket. It is easy to change the
serialization format to xml or json using the suitable serializer and
deserializer.
